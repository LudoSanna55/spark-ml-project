# PySpark ML Pipeline - Contcrisis Project

This project implements a **ML pipeline** with PySpark for binary
classification of a dataset.
The goal is to predict the target variable 'contcrisis' using machine learning models.

## Features
- Dataset cleaning.
- Transformation of numerical and categorical variables.
- Target class balancing with weights.
- Training of two models:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - F1-score
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - AUC (Area Under ROC)
  - MCC
- Graphic visualization.

## Project structure 
- 'ProgettoBigLab.py' -> main script
- 'finaldataset_1.csv' -> dataset
